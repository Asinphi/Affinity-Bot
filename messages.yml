            Multipliers increase the exp rate when earning exp.

            Use `%prefix%multiplier <user> <multiplier> <duration (optional)>` to give **<user>** a multiplier of **<multiplier>**.
            If a duration is given, the temporary multiplier will last **<duration>** from when the command is executed.
            If no duration is given, the user will be given a pernament multiplier.
            The multiplier must be a float greater than 1 and at most 14641.

            Some events giving out large amounts of exp may be multiplier immune.
